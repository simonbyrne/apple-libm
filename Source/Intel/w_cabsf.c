/* Modified by Stephen Canon on Sept 18, 2006 to do computation in double
 * precision, without calling cabs(double complex). This works because we
 * can't get undue underflow or overflow, but we do need to check for ±°.
 *
 * Also tried out the following SSE3 code:
 *
 *     xDouble xy = _mm_cvtps_pd(_mm_load_ps(&z));
 *     xy = _mm_andnot_pd(minusZeroD,xy);
 *     if ( EXPECT_FALSE( _mm_movemask_pd ( _mm_cmpeq_pd( xy, infinityD ) ) ) )
 *       return __builtin_inf();
 *	   xy = _mm_mul_pd(xy,xy);
 *     xy = _mm_hadd_pd(xy,xy);
 *     xy = __builtin_ia32_sqrtsd(xy);
 *     return XDOUBLE_2_FLOAT(xy);
 *
 * but the x87 code is about twice as fast, and doesn't need SSE3.
 * (and doesn't depend on stack alignment magic)
 ************************************************************************
 *
 * the old code for this function:
 * float cabsf( float complex z ) { return (float)cabs((double complex)z); }
 *

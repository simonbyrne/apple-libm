/*	The following implementations of long double functions use double
	functions.

	THESE ARE NOT GOOD IMPLEMENTATIONS.

	These implementations are placedholders to allow programs to build and get
	crude results (results with the accuracies of the double-precision
	functions).  This is only for a proof-of-concept demonstration of Mac OS X
	for WWDC and should not become part of a product.

	Aside from the general loss of precision, functions that work with the
	floating-point representation, such as nextafter, will be wrong.

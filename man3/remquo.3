.Sh NAME
.Nm remquo
.Nd floating-point remainder and quotient function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn remquo "double x" "double y" "int *quo"
.Ft float
.Fn remquof "float x" "float y" "int *quo"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn remquo
and
.Fn remquof
functions compute the value r such that r = x - n*y, where n is the integer nearest the exact value of x/y.
.Pp
If there are two integers closest to x/y, n shall be the even one. If r is zero, it is given the same sign as x.
This is the same value that is returned by the 
.Fn remainder
function.
.Fn remquo
also calculates the lower seven bits of the integral quotient x/y, and gives that value the same sign as
x/y. It stores this signed value in the object pointed to by quo. 
.Sh SPECIAL VALUES
.Fn remquo "x, y, quo"
returns a NaN and raises the "invalid" floating-point exception if x is infinite or y is 0.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr math 3 ,
.Xr remainder 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn remquo
and
.Fn remquof
functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999(E).
